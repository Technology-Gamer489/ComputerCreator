     * This program will ask the user how much money they have to spend on a new computer
     * The money entered will limit what PC components can be used
     * PC components will be compatibility checked - this will be done with research (references will be mentioned)
     * If all parts are compatible, a final list will be displayed with the full specs of the PC chosen
